# Assignment
# ==========
#> As a programmer, assignment and types should not be surprising to you!

# Strings
#> notice how you can access characters in the string using array syntax
data = 'hello world'
print( data[0] )
print( len(data) )
print( data )

# Numbers
value = 123.1
print( value )
value = 10
print( value )

# Boolean
a = True
b = False
print( a, b )

# Multiple Assignment
#> This can also be very handy for unpacking data in simple data structures
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print( a, b, c )

# No value
a = None
print(a)



# Flow Control
# ============
#> There are three main types of flow control that you need to learn:
#> If-Then-Else conditions, For-Loops and While-Loops

# If-Then-Else
value =60
if value < 60:
   print( 'That is safe' )
elif value < 120:
   print( 'That is fast' )
else:
   print( 'That is too fast' )

# For-Loop
for i in range(10):
   print(i)

# While-Loop
i = 0
while i < 10:
   print( i )
   i += 1


# Data Structures
# ===============
#> There are three data structures in Python that you will find the most used and useful.
#> They are tuples, lists and dictionaries

# Tuple (cannot change - immutable)
#> read-only collections of items
a = (1, 2, 3)
print( a )


# Lists
#> use the square bracket notation and can be indexed using array notation
#> Notice that we are using some simple printf-like
#> functionality to combine strings and variables when printing
mylist = [1, 2, 3]
print( "Zeroth Value: %d" % mylist[0] )
mylist.append(4)
print( "List Length: %d" % len(mylist) )
for value in mylist:
   print( value )



# Dictionaries
#> mappings of names to values, like key-value pairs
#> Note the use of the curly bracket, and
#> colon notations when defining the dictionary
mydict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print( "A value: %d" % mydict['a'] )
mydict['a'] = 11
print( "A value: %d" % mydict['a'] )
print( "Keys: %s" % mydict.keys() )
print( "Values: %s" % mydict.values() )
for key in mydict.keys():
   print( mydict[key] )


# Functions
# ===========
#> The biggest gotcha with Python is the whitespace
#> Ensure that you have an empty new line after indented code

# Sum function
def mysum(x, y):
   return x + y

# Test sum function
x = mysum( 1000, 3333 )
print( x )

# A function that is called in case this file is not being imported
def main():
   mysum( 2, 4 )


#_______________________________________________________________________________
# the starting point whenever this file is not being imported (from another)
if __name__=="__main__":
   main()
